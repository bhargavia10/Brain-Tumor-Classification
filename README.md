# Brain-Tumor-Classification

## About the Project
This project leverages machine learning to classify and evaluate
four types of brain tumors: meningioma, glioma, pituitary, and none. By 
leveraging transfer learning, it applies the pre-trained Xception model
onto a smaller Kaggle dataset achieving ~99% accuracy. A CNN was also trained 
on the same dataset achieving ~98% accuracy. In addition to identifying the
tumor, this model provides a comprehensive report on the prediction and
next steps for patients.

## Features
- Predicts tumor based on input image
- Displays saliency maps used for prediction
- Provides probabilities of each possible tumor with graphical visuals
- Explanations of predictions generated by Gemini 1.5 Flash
